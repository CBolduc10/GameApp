1. Use a noSQL file (or something) to store time / score.
  - Add text field to enter a name as well.

2. Add a homepage that displays available games
  - Play button: play the selected game
  - Scores button: dispaly a list of scores for the selected game

3. Add a game config page before starting the game
  - number of blocks (difficulty, easy = 10, medium  = 20, hard = 30, along with smaller size)
  - speed of ball (follow same pattern, 1, 2, 3)

4. special blocks, different point values.
  - To add challange, set to randomly pick an active block to set as a "special block"
  - else change this after a block is destroyed + 1 sec or something

5. Power ups:
  - Gemini: Create a second ball
    - would require us to be able to manage more than one ball at a time.
  - DU ball: Ball can blast through blocks without changing direction
    - MAke this last 3-5 blocks, or 2-3 wall / paddle hits.
  - Double Points: Every block hit for next 5 seconds is worth double points (inclding special blocks)

6. Modifiers:
  - Teleporter item: Randomly teleport the ball, and give it "random" velocity
    - slow ball down to half speed until it hits something, then full speed.
7. Levels:
  - 3-5 "levels" where score is kept, and game is auto-reset after you win a level.
  - perhaps increase difficulty with faster ball or more detrimental effects
